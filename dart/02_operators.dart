/* This code covers the basic know-hows of dart language focussing on operators in dart, and assumes that:
  - flutter and dart have been installed in the system,
  - `flutter` and `dart` are recognized as global commands, and 
  - dart programs can be run simply by typing `dart \path\to\dart_program_name.dart` 

Alternatively, one can make use of https://dartpad.dev/ for running the dart snippets.*/
